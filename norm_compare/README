 
simple demo to see the normalization factor ratio between high L and S

From this small function, it's easy to see that for exponential < 1;
L becomes larger, normalization factor is smaller; and as exponential
getting more and more smaller; normalization factor decreases quickly.

On the other hand, for exp>1; L becomes larger the normalization factor
is getting larger.
