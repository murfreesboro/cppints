#             this is the configuration file                  #
#             for doing the integral generation               #
###############################################################
# 
# here we will list all possible keywords:
#
# hrr_method(vrr_method):
#   in general, the program could support multiple VRR method or even 
#   HRR methods. in default, HRR method is hgp, VRR method is OS.
#
# hrr_print_max_l(vrr_print_max_l): 
#   this is used to set up the maximum sum of L (all integral dimensions)
#   to determine that whether we use array/variable form for HRR/VRR.
#   see the infor.cpp, sqintsinfor.cpp(constructor) for more information.
#
# single_cpp_max_l: 
#   for large angular momentum case, it's difficult to put everything 
#   into one single file. Therefore for the too high L integral case,
#   we may have one cpp file, one _vrr.cpp and one _hrr.cpp. 
#   This option will determine that what kind of L sum will generate
#   multiple cpp files.
#
# vector_form:
#   for the array type of variable, we have three types so far:
#   * STD vector with TBB allocator;
#   * STD vector with STD allocator;
#   * a memory management class to allocate space for the array (see
#     the localmemscr.h in the test/include)
#   this option determines which type we use for array.
#
# m_limit:
#   this is related to the M limit used to calculate fmt function.
#   currently m_limit is only allowed to be 8, 9 or 10
#   default is 10



# job list is a list of integral works we will perform
# in running of codes. The integral name list please see
# the inttype.cpp and inttype.h
#job_list = TWOBODYOVERLAP THREEBODYOVERLAP NAI KINETIC THREEBODYKI TWOBODYERI THREEBODYERI ERI ESP MOM

# maxl is the maximum angular momentum for integral file generation
# for example, maxl = 3 will generate all of S, P, D and F integral
# combinations.
maxl         = 3

# for some integral generation, the angular momentum is passed as 
# auxiliary dimension(for example, MOM integral). This is used to 
# specify the largest angular momentum for this dimension.
aux_max_l    = 5

# set up derivatives order for the result cpp codes. deriv_order = 2
# will generate cpp files for second derivatives calculation. 
# deric_order is in default to be 0.
deriv_order  = 2

# the file split module is automatically turned on
# however, if you want to turn it off, please mark 
# it as false
