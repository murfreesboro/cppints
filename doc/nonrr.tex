\section{What is Non-RR Code Module?}
\label{what_is_non_rr}

Comparing with Recurrence Relation(RR) modules, non-RR modules are referring to these
that the result integrals are directly calculated from module's input. For example,
the LHS integral for derivatives calculation is directly generated from RHS integrals,
where the RHS integrals are from previous modules.

non-RR modules are divided into two types: normal non-RR module and derivative module.
Normal non-RR module right now only contain the three body kinetic integrals, where 
the LHS integrals are expressed as linear combination of derivatives of three 
body overlap integrals. In this sense the three body kinetic integrals is also a 
derivative module, except that normal derivatives is on basis set nuclei, but the 
three body kinetic integral is on electron coordinate.

non-RR modules does not have temporary integrals. It's input directly generates the 
module output. Therefore it does not has optimal path searching problem(see section
\ref{optimal_path}). However, redundant integral elimination still applies to the 
non-RR modules. For the given output integral results; depending on the expression
the result RHS integrals may have redundancy\footnote{please see the section of 
\ref{redundancy_rr} for more information}.
